<p><span class="teaser">Pre-fight rituals</span> for me are very important. Itâ€™s what really determines how you feel coming into a match. When I did my first Jiujitsu tournament a couple of years ago it was rough due to several things.</p>
<p>It was my first time cutting weight. I was very unsure about my takedown defense with the amount of wrestlers in my division.</p>
<p> One of my friends, a blue belt at the time, drilled guillotines with me literally five minutes before my first match, and I ended up beating all three guys in my division with that very submission taking gold. It was really a life changing experience for me...</p>
<p>Like most everyone who competes I feel we all wish to be able to do this sport for a living. I would like it one day to make the world stage and be able to called one of the best in the sport.</p>
<p>You can gain money by working yourself to the bone. But winning and competing for championships, titles, etc. I feel like no one can take that away from you, because that will just be part of your legacy.</p>
